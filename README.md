# PentestUbuntu
This is just a simple bash script that will install the basic pentest tools into a fresh Ubuntu install.

This script was ~~inspired~~ copied from John Hammond repository [ignition_key](https://github.com/JohnHammond/ignition_key) and modified to my needs.

# Usage
```bash
chmod +x newmachine.sh
sudo ./newmachine.sh
```
